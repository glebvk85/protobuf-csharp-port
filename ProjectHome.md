# This Google Code project is now on hold (but the code certainly isn't...) #

A [Github clone of this project](http://github.com/jskeet/protobuf-csharp-port) exists so that others can fork it as required, if they need the code working the way it does now.

Proto3 support (as well as `oneof` and `map` support) will be worked on in the [main Protobuf github project](http://github.com/google/protobuf) in a new major version. This is expected to be backwardly incompatible in potentially numerous ways; as of April 2015 work has started, but is far from complete.

Please join the [Protobuf C# mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/protobuf-csharp) to get involved and stay up to date.

"Protocol Buffers" is a binary serialization format and technology, released to the open source community by Google in 2008.

There are various implementations of Protocol Buffers in .NET. This project is a fairly close port of the Google Java implementation.

There are two main parts:

`ProtoGen.exe`, which takes binary representations of protocol buffer descriptors (as generated by the "stock" protoc binary supplied by Google) and creates C# source code. This is only required at build time.

`Google.ProtocolBuffers.dll`, which is a supporting library. This is required at execution time.

As of April 2011, all development for this project will be performed in the [Google Code Mercurial repository](http://code.google.com/p/protobuf-csharp-port/source/checkout); the old [GitHub project](http://github.com/jskeet/dotnet-protobufs/tree/master) is obsolete.

There is API documentation available [here](http://help.protobuffers.net/), which can also be downloaded as a [CHM file](http://help.protobuffers.net/protobuf-csharp-port.chm).
